title: Adding to the zoo
---

Today I had the pleasure to attend a workshop put together by the [stdpopsim consortium](https://elifesciences.org/articles/54967).  The primary goal of the group is the creation of a highly standardized set of population genetic simulation models to be used in a variety of research purposes (e.g. testing out new analysis methods, comparisons of historical results to more recently derived datasets, etc.). In the past, I have attended a [workshop](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/workshops/tree/main/intro_stdpopsim) from the same group describing how to get started with using the basic functionality of stdpopsim. The focus of today’s workshop was a demonstration of how one might go about adding new species to the catalog, hence the title [‘Adding to the zoo’](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/workshops/tree/main/adding_species). The workshop was really fun, and I’m really impressed with both the elegance of the tool and the cohesive vision of the developers. I think there’s a good bit of work to do on my side to get the *Daphnia magna* genome into the catalog but I hope to be able to do it in the coming months.
