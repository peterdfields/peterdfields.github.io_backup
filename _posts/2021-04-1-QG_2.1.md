# Chapter 2: Forces of change in allele frequencies

#### In a population of gazelles, 200 individuals were analyzed for the $\alpha$ - amylase gene, finding three allelic variants (*A*$_1$,*A*$_2$,*A*$_3$) and the observed genotype frequencies indicated in the following table. 

| Genotype | *A*$_1$*A*$_1$ | *A*$_1$*A*$_2$ | *A*$_1$*A*$_3$ | *A*$_2$*A*$_2$ | *A*$_2$*A*$_3$ | *A*$_3$*A*$_3$ | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Number | 23 | 61 | 28 | 39 | 41 | 8 | 200 |

#### (a) What is the value of the expected heterozygosity in the population?
Here we can write out the expected heterozygosity, *H*, as:

*H* = 1 - $\sum_{i=1}^{n} p^2_i$,

So, let's get the frequency for each of these alleles by defining population size and also a variable for each genotype:

```
N <- 200;
a <- 23;
b <- 61;
c <- 28;
d <- 39;
e <- 49;
f <- 8;
# Now, let's get the frequencies of each allele
p1 <- (23+(61/2)+(28/2))/200
print(p1)
p2 <- ((61/2)+39+(41/2))/200
print(p2)
p3 <- ((28/2)+(41/2)+8)/200
print(p3)
[1] 0.3375
[1] 0.45
[1] 0.2125
```
#### Now we just need subtract the squares from 1
```
H <- 1 - (p1)^2 - (p2)^2 - (p3)^2
print(H)
[1] 0.6384375
```
