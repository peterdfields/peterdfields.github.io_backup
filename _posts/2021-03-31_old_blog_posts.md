Some of my first blogging came from a few years stint contributing to [The Molecular Ecologist](https://www.molecularecologist.com/), a great source of information and summaries of ongoing research coming from the publishers of [*Molecular Ecology*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1365294x) and [*Molecular Ecology Resources*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/17550998).  If you’re interested you can find the different pieces I worked on either myself or upon my invitation using the links below. Enjoy!

PS. I'd recommend bioconda over homebrew these days.
