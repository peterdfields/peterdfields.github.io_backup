# [Peter D. Fields Online Notebook](http://peterdfields.github.io/)

Here I'm attempting to document some of my work using an online notebook.  
  
  
  The theme for the page is based upon [Hyde](http://andhyde.com/), an elegant open source, mobile-first theme for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It includes lightweight styles and placeholder content to get you up and running with a simple blog in no time.
